## Notes
### Q: What is the mean of `[]` after every filename?
A: The language.

- zh_TW: Chinese (Traditional) Documentations (The native language of author own, more complete than another.)
- en_US: English (US) Documentations (The second language of author own, might has some wrong grammers.)

### Q: When I found typo/documentation omission, how do I to report it?
A: Open a Pull Request to send improved documentation to authors directly,
   or open a Issues to let authors know that.
   
(!) When you submit omission/typo by Issues, the priority will be lower that PR.
